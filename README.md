## Predicting College Quarterback Success at the NFL Level

The main goal of this project is to take the signifigant combine measureables and results for quarterbacks such as Height, Weight, BMI, 40 YD time, etc and then add in quarterbacks career college statistics to see if I can accurately predict if they have made a Pro Bowl at the NFL level. At least one Pro Bowl selection means that a quarterback has had at least one productive season in the NFL where they have been recognized as one of the best at there position. While recently the honor of making the Pro Bowl has become less prestegious with players such as Gardner Minshew and Tyler Huntley being selected it still remains a historically reliable benchmark of quarterback success. It is extremely difficult to find who the next Patrick Mahomes or Tom Brady will be, however it is a realistic objective to try to identify which quarterbacks will be above average at the next level.
