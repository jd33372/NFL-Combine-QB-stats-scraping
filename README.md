## Predicting College Quarterback Success at the NFL Level

The main goal of this project is to take the signifigant combine measureables for quarterbacks such as Height, Weight, BMI, 40 YD time, etc and then add in a quarterbacks career college stats to see if I can accurately predict if they have made a pro bowl at the nfl level. At least one pro bowl selection means that a quarterback has had at least one productive season in the NFL where they have been recognized as one of the best in there position. While recently the honor of making the pro bowl has become less prestegious with players such as Gardner Minshew and Tyler Huntley being selected it still remains a historically reliable benchmark of quarterback success. My main goal is to see if the signifigant physical attributes in quarterbacks plus college statistics can predict if a quarterback will sustain some level of success in the the NFL level.
